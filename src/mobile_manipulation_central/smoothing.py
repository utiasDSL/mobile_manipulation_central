    Parameters
    ----------
    τ : float
        The filter time constant. Must be non-negative.
    x0 :
        The initial value. Can be ``None``, in which case the first value
        passed to ``self.update`` will be used.

    Attributes
    ----------
    τ : float
        The filter time constant.
    x :
        The current estimate.

    Raises
    ------
    AssertionError
        If ``τ`` is negative.
